# Question
# In Python, a dictionary can only hold a single value for a given key. To workaround this, our single value can be a list containing multiple values. Here we have a dictionary called "wardrobe" with items of clothing and their colors. Fill in the blanks to print a line for each item of clothing with each color, for example: "red shirt", "blue shirt", and so on.

wardrobe = {"shirt":["red","blue","white"], "jeans":["blue","black"]}
for item, color in wardrobe.items():
	for c in color:
		print("{} {}".format(c, item))

# Question 1
# The email_list function receives a dictionary, which contains domain names as keys, and a list of users as values. Fill in the blanks to generate a list that contains complete email addresses (e.g. diana.prince@gmail.com).

def email_list(domains):
	emails = []
	for domain, users in domains.items():
	  for user in users:
	    emails.append("{}@{}".format(user, domain))
	return(emails)

print(email_list({"gmail.com": ["clark.kent", "diana.prince", "peter.parker"], "yahoo.com": ["barbara.gordon", "jean.grey"], "hotmail.com": ["bruce.wayne"]}))

# Question 2
# The groups_per_user function receives a dictionary, which contains group names with the list of users. Users can belong to multiple groups. Fill in the blanks to return a dictionary with the users as keys and a list of their groups as values. 

def groups_per_user(group_dictionary):
	user_groups = {}
	# Go through group_dictionary
	for group, users in group_dictionary.items():
		# Now go through the users in the group
		for user in users:
			if user in user_groups.keys():
				user_groups[user].append(group)
			else:
				user_groups[user] = [group]

	return(user_groups)

print(groups_per_user({"local": ["admin", "userA"],
		"public":  ["admin", "userB"],
		"administrator": ["admin"] }))
